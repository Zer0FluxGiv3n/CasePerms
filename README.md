# CasePerms
Simple script to take a file, and do various capitalizations for the contents on each line of the file.

Got tired of going back doing this manually when I had something like a list of usernames and/or potential passwords.

Syntax:
`CasePerm.sh -f <inputfile>`

I'm a very amateur bash scripted, so don't judge my flawed code too hard!
